# `Hi there, I'm Edward`

I'm a web developer, interface designer, and full-time computer science student at the University of San Francisco. I have several years' experience in web design, from WordPress to Next.js. I also founded and run the largest CS club on campus, [compsigh][compsigh].

Currently, I'm working on my latest project, [Cue][cue] â€” a study app that transforms your notes into active recall questions.

You can learn more about me and connect over at [my website][website], [Twitter][twitter], or [read.cv][read.cv].

Have a great day. :)
