# `Hi there, I'm Edward`

I'm a web developer, interface designer, and full-time computer science student at the University of San Francisco. I have several years' experience in web design, from WordPress to Next.js. I also founded and run the largest CS club on campus, [compsigh][compsigh].

Currently, I'm working on my latest project, [Cue][cue] â€” a web app that transforms students' notes into active recall study questions.

Thanks for visiting my profile! You can learn more about me and connect over at [my website][website], Twitter[twitter], or [read.cv][read.cv].

Have a great day. :)
