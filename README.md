# `Hi there, I'm Edward`

I'm a web developer, interface designer, and community builder based in San Francisco.

I'm currently focused on running [compsigh][compsigh], the largest CS club on campus at the University of San Francisco, where I study computer science.

You can learn more about me & what I'm working on, and connect over at [my website][website], [Twitter][twitter], or [read.cv][read.cv].

Have a great day. :)
