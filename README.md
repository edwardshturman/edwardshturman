**📚 Education —**

As a graduating high school student from the [Ultimate Incubator](https://www.wired.com/story/design-tech-high-school/), I enjoy employing design thinking when solving problems. This philosophy has helped in many of my projects in education, including fundraising $35K to build a school in Nepal, researching social robotics in AI in collaboration with the Stanford Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Education (AIRE) Lab, recreating my high school in a virtual environment, and more.

As I grow in my college career, I'm excited to learn more about problems I come across for me, my friends, my school, and my community, and what I want to do to solve them.

**🌟 Works-In-Progress —**

From my open-source work, check out [Register](https://edwardshturman.com/register): a high-quality Discord bot for event planning. Or, another Discord bot, [Rollup](https://edwardshturman.com/rollup), for keeping clean channels using threading.

Some cool, yet-to-be-announced projects I'm working on include a game-changing security feature for Discord, and an educational/corporate accountability tool, allowing admins to better communicate with their students + staff on policy changes. Taking feedback empowers these groups in their self-advocacy, an important skill in the 21st century.
